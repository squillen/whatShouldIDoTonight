Sound smart at parties, but don't, you know, be [*that*](https://youtu.be/Kb22Dcrizp0?t=115) guy. Add something useful to the comments section. Just kidding, don't look at the comments. Ever.

Learn about elections and candidates, local policies, the stock market, money management, that new invasive species that's taking over. Just learn and be informed!

To start, check out [the Skimm'](http://www.theskimm.com/?r=1f162672) and the [Monring Brew](https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/r/?kid=4ddcaea1) to get informed more easily and quickly (fo' free!). And yes, those are my personal referral codes, and no, I don't get anything from them (besides bragging rights).

Then, once you're ready to play with the big dogs and go straight to the source, sign up for a subscription to [the Wall Street Journal](https://store.wsj.com/shop/us/us/wsjuelnsb20/?trackingCode=aaqwghw1&cid=WSJ_SCH_GOO_ACQ_NA&n2IKsaD9=n2IKsaD9&Pg9aWOPT=Pg9aWOPT&Cp5dKJWb=Cp5dKJWb&APCc9OU1=APCc9OU1&tier_1=US%20-%20Acquisition%20-%20Search%20-%20DR%20-%20Brand%20-%20Core%20Offer%20-%20Top%20KW%20-%20Exact&tier_2=bing&tier_3=US%20-%20Acquisition%20-%20Search%20-%20DR%20-%20Brand%20-%20Core%20Offer%20-%20Top%20KW%20-%20Exact&tier_4=Brand%20-%20Top%20Tier%20-%20Exact%20-%20Wall%20Street%20Journal&tier_5=wall%20street%20journal%20journal), where you get professional, unbiased facts on important stories. (Sorry, Uncle Don, you and your facebook articles just don't know shit.) Yea, it's a little on the pricier side in the age of "free" news, but you definitely get what you pay for.

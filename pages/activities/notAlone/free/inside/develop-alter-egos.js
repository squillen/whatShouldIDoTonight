      Clark Kent goes from a puny nobody to everyone&apos;s hero (without doing anything to his face, fucking stupid, but whatever).

      that developing an alter ego can be beneficial to your life. &quot;Your life&quot; as in non-alter ego you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you want to be more confident / determined / charismatic / etc. in the office / bedroom / gym / wherever, an alter ego could be a tool to help you achieve that.
      Ask the person/people you&apos;re with what they think would be good in your alter ego (e.g. &quot;I could see yours being someone who doesn&apos;t take any shit from people&quot;).

      I&apos;d wish you luck, but y&apos;alls alter egos don&apos;t need any damn luck.

Do you like the Talking Heads? Whatever you just said, it doesn't matter. 

[This freaking movie](https://amzn.to/3matDhu) is an absolute clinic on filmmaking and its subject, the Talking Heads, are an endlessly entertaining and thought-provoking group of seemingly boundlessly talented eclectics.

And if you look at the release date, 1984, and think, "Oh that's old and therefor no longer relevant", grab a towel because you have shit for brains and they're leaking out of your ears. No, I'm kidding, you're smart and beautiful and perfect. But you should watch it. I mean, it's got near-perfect ratings on [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/stop_making_sense).

Oh, and, if you have Prime, **it's free**!

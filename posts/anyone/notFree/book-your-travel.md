You've been saying that you're gonna go to Italy/Maine/Cuba/Costa Rica/wherever for ages now. Do it!

If you haven't been kicking any ideas around, [start to](https://www.whatshouldidotonight.com/posts/anyone/free/plan-your-next-travel)! And book it!

Once you're set, check out sites like [priceline](https://www.priceline.com/), [agoda](https://www.agoda.com), [Kayak](https://www.kayak.com/) for flights/hotels/rental cars and sites like [hotels.com](https://wwww.hotels.com/) and [vrbo](https://www.vrbo.com/) for even more special travel housing options.

See which times are best/cheapest for you, but make sure those times coincide with the time of the year that the weather/popularity is what you want, too!

If you need any new luggage, [ebags](https://www.ebags.com/) has you covered. Otherwise, [travelpro](https://www.travelpro.com/) makes some of the best damn luggage out there.

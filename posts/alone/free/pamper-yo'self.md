Sometimes you need to be reminded to treat yourself. This is your reminder.

If you've got face masks, whitening strips, nasal pore strips, that kinda gross foot stone thing, and the like, go ahead and use any/all of those.

If not, check out [this](https://www.thepennyhoarder.com/save-money/diy-spa-day-for-cheap/) shit out.

Now turn on a good movie, get a cup of tea (or a glass of wine/whatever) and get ready for a cheap, relaxing night &#128522

*p.s. this goes for guys, too, 'cause remember, real men don't give a shit.*

Yo, scrub, git gud and start gaining some XP by pwning some noobs. 

If you don't get that, check out [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2FgRMlC), where you can, of course, buy any freaking game out there.

Or just google "popular gaming phrases" like I did &#128517

Or, if you don't want to commit to a game just yet, you can rent one (or many!) from [gamefly](https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-100215369-13890619) (with a free trial even!) and have them shipped to you lickety split.

Or, if you are bored as all fuckshit right now, check out [steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) where you can start playing this very second.

Orrrr if none of those do it for you and you're feeling a little more voyeuristic, watch people play on [twitch](https://twitch.tv/), you kinky devil you.

****mom hat on****

*As someone who has spent many late nights building different civs and sports franchises, I just want to reiterate that you should be careful with this one and don't let these games take over your night...or life!*

****mom hat off****

That was weird since I don't have any kids...and I'm a man.

Now go Leeroy Jenkins that shit.

Ok, not really, I mean go for it, but I just didn't want you to blow past the real suggestion here, which is to **make a budget**.

Wait wait!! Keep reading, it's...OK, it's not fun but it can seriously be kind of satisfying once you get into it.

There are a couple of free sites like [mint](https://www.mint.com/), [NerdWallet](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/how-to-build-a-budget/) and [money under 30](https://www.moneyunder30.com/no-more-budgets) to help you out.

You can even use a budget [I created](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xUMVBjuV-0n721CktT7kYp8m2HFI64ZSK_O-9kRaKKQ/edit?usp=sharing) a little while ago, if you want.

There are also paid sites likes [You Need A Budget](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) that might be helpful, too.

And now, for reading this whole post, [here's a picture of some puppies in a wagon](https://i.ibb.co/mTFDB5G/photo-1582068955580-dcc6c0812b21-ixlib-rb-1-2.jpg).

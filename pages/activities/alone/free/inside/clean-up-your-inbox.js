      If you saw &quot;3,502 unread emails&quot; and thought, &quot;I wish&quot;,
      this suggestion is for you. And it&apos;s no longer a suggestion:

      Yea, sure, it&apos;s not the most exciting, but get it down by 300 and then
      come back and find something else to do. You&apos;ll be happy you did.

      Also, if you have Gmail (and prob other mail services...),
      you can just cheat and mark all as read ðŸ˜‰.
      I imagine seeing that number go from 3,000+ unread to none is the closest feeling
      I&apos;ll get to heroine ðŸ¤¤

    <p>Now go clear at least 300 emails and get a tiny bump of heaven.</p>

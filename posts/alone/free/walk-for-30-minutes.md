Walk to the store. Walk around the block. Just make sure you walk for at least 30 minutes straight.

Think about what you're going to do tomorrow while you're on your walk. Or your finances. Or about a trip you want to go on.

Or check out a thought-provoking podcast or some energizing music.

Or just listen to the noises around you and pay attention to all the sights.

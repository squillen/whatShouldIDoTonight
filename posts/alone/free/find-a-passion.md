Did you find it yet? Sweet. Next.

Alright, fine, maybe it's not that easy.

Spend at least an hour tonight thinking about things to do in life. 

Not like, "I need to change the world" kind of thoughts, just "life can be pretty awesome and I want to take advantage of that" kind of thoughts.

[Here](https://medium.com/the-mission/how-to-find-your-true-passion-and-live-a-life-you-wont-regret-on-your-deathbed-c58ce450beaf) are a [couple](https://youtu.be/6pgaJb2Wwhs) of places to start.

Have fun with it, though. Don't put too much pressure on yourself. Have a glass of wine or a cup of tea and just enjoy the process!

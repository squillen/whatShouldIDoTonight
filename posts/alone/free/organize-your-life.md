Go through your fridge/pantry/closet/ nightstand/whatever and be ruthless (think: [Marie Kondo](https://amzn.to/3iad7LU)).

Get rid of useless stuff, de-clutter, and get some organization going on, maggot! Whoa, sorry, I got too excited.

Check out groups like [go clean co](https://www.instagram.com/gocleanco/) for ideas/inspiration.

Next, if you have anything to sell, sell it! Sites like [thredup](https://thredup.com) are good for clothes, or just donate everything locally!

You don't need anything to start right now, just a small trash bag or trash can.

Go ahead and read [this site](https://learn.eartheasy.com/guides/composting/) for some good composting basics then go through your fridge for any old items you can add right now.

If you don't have any space/a backyard, try composting with [worms](https://amzn.to/2QzM40f).

Check out [this site](https://www.backyardgardenlover.com/how-to-compost-with-worms/) for some more specific info on composting with worms.

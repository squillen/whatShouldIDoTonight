It's surprisingly easy...and unsurprisingly unhealthy. I mean, it's almost literally just "iced" cream. But whatever, you can do the frozen yogurt (or water ice) options instead if you're concerned.

If you're not sold on whether you want one or not, check out [these recipes](https://www.countryliving.com/food-drinks/g952/easy-homemade-ice-cream-0610/) and reconsider. If you still said no, you either already have one or you are a demon.

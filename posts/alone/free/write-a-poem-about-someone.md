Make it about your mom/dad/sibling/ grandma/friend/neighbor/ whoever.

Don't know the first thing about poetry? Check [this](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/how-to-write-poetry#11-rules-for-writing-good-poetry) out first and then give it a go.

If you like how it turns out, share it with them! Unless it was something like:

> *Roses are red, violets are blue.*<br>
> *Josh is shitty and he looks like a shoe.*

Josh, you ugly.

      If you saw &quot;3502 unread emails&quot; and thought, &quot;I wish&quot;,
      this suggestion is for you. And it&apos;s no longer a suggestion.

    <p>Yea, sure, it&apos;s not the most exciting, but get it down by 300 and then come back and find something else to do.</p>
    <p>
      Also, if you have Gmail (and prob other mail services...), you can just cheat and mark all as read ðŸ˜‰
      I imagine seeing that number go from 3,000+ to nothing is the closest feeling
      I&apos;ll get to heroine ðŸ¤¤
    </p>
    <p>Now go clear at least 300 emails.</p>

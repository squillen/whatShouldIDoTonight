Pick a movie and cook something related to the area that it's filmed in/related to the film.

So, for example, if you pick [The Godfather](https://amzn.to/3hjAa5A), make (or buy) some veal marsala (tuxedo optional, but not really).

If you pick Oldboy, make some bibimbop.

Or, say you really want sushi, maybe watch Spirited Away or Battle Royale.

Bonus if you also add the drink of choice from the region you choose!

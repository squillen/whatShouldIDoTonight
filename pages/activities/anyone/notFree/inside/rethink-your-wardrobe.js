      Our wardrobe says a lot about who we are and we (and styles) are always changing, so shouldn&apos;t our clothes change with that?
      Not to mention the sense of confidence that comes with some new threads (anyone remember the first day of school??)

        Luckily there are lots of places to help you out, like
        {' '}
        <LinkTo
          href="https://www.stitchfix.com/invite/hrj7rwh5vb?sod=w&som=c"
          label="Stitch Fix"
        />
        , where you&apos;ll also get a credit of $25 when you use that link.
      </span>
    </p>

        Or, you can also check out
        {' '}
        <LinkTo
          href="https://www.thread.com/SaUuUflamNHZE4w259IgQm9yMTuaCqfXU"
          label="Thread"
        />
        , where you&apos;ll actually get a $30 credit, and see if that appeals to you more.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Either way, you&apos;ll get personal fashion stylists to help
      figure out your current/future style and to give you real recommendations.

Walk to the store. Walk around the block. Just make sure you all walk for at least 30 minutes straight.

Talk to each other. If you want some prompts, ask each other: 

 1. What is your favorite city in the world? Why? 
 2. What is your perfect day? 
 3. Are you a good person?
 4. Describe your perfect meal in your perfect setting.
 5. Would you rather be rich or famous?
 6. What song would you play at your funeral?

That's right. Not 3 questions. Not 5. 6 questions. Now talk about the complete monsters we are.

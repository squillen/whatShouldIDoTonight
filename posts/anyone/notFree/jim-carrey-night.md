Stressed? Bored? Angry? Keep calm and Carrey on. The Truman Show, Dumb and Dumber, Ace Ventura, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, The Cable Guy?? I mean come on! The list is basically endless.

Rent some from [Amazon](https://amzn.to/324hNgW) and don't be a loo-hoo-zuh-her, throw another shrimp on the barbie, and go and totally redeem yourself!

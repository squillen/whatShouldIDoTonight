This is not to be the cynosure of all ears or to practice grandiloquent circumlocution. No, this is at the behoovement of your impending illustrious, splendiferous (but not supercilious!)  locution that will, indubitably, improve your acumen across many fields, and thereby prove quite remunerative!

One of those words is not real. Your job is to figure out which one.

To help you, check out [vocabulary.com](https://www.vocabulary.com/) and [dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/). They've also got some word "games" you can play.

Once you've done that, sign yourself up for some word of the day emails from places like [merriam-webster.com](https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day) and, again, [dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/)

Be assiduous in your efforts and auspicious events will surely follow. (oh wait, that's just from a fortune cookie.)

If you already have/know an instrument, play it. Learn one new song you like.

Don't know (or have) an instrument yet? Check out [GuitarCenter](https://www.guitarcenter.com/)  or go local and find one that you want to learn how to play.

And if you really don't want to spend any money, check out sites [like this one](https://www.virtualmusicalinstruments.com/) and see if that is interesting at all.

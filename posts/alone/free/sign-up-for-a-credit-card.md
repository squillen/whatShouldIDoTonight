TODO CHANGE

Don't just sign up for one willy-nilly, only do it if you're in a position to and it actually benefits you.

That said, there are a lot of credit cards out there who want you to sign up, and that means that they're willing to give you some pretty great benefits, like cash back or miles/travel benefits.
